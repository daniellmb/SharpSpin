### How to use

```
var spun_text = Spinner.Spin("The {quick|fast} brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.");

var spun_text = Spinner.Spin("The {quick|fast} brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.", 555); //You can send a seed for the randomizer if you want it to static for a particular page

```

### Quick Guide to Spinning Syntax

#### Nested Spinning Vs. Flat Spinning
There are 2 types of spinning - flat spinning (Jet format) and nested spinning. Flat spun content only has one level of spinning, while a nested spun format allows you to spin phrases within phrases.

Sample sentence
> The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

###Flat Spinning
```
The {quick|fast} brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
```

###### Example nested spun variations
- The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
- The fast brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

###Nested Spinning
```
The {quick {brown|red}|smart} fox jumped over the lazy dog.
```

###### Example nested spun variations
- The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
- The quick red fox jumped over the lazy dog.
- The smart fox jumped over the lazy dog.

###Complex Nested Spinning
```
{The {quick|fast|speedy} brown fox {jumped|leaped|hopped} {over|right over|over the top of} 
the {lazy|sluggish|care-free|relaxing} dog.|{While|Although} just {taking|having} 
a{| little| quick} {siesta|nap} the dog was {startled|shocked|surprised} by a {quick|fast|speedy} 
{brown|dark brown|brownish} fox that {leaped|jumped} right {over|over the top of} him.}
```

###### Yes, you can do things like this:
```
{a|b{c|d{e|f{g|h{i|j{k|l{m|n{o|p{q|r{s|t{u|v{w|x{y|z}}}}}}}}}}}}}
```

###### Pro Tip
If you use nesting wisely, you get `{a wide variety of|very different}` content.

1. Spin first at the paragraph level. If you divide your content into stand alone paragraphs on the same subject and write enough paragraphs, you can easily make paragraph-based spun content.
2. Then rewrite every sentence of every paragraph 3 times. This is your second spin level within the paragraph level.
3. Third you can spin words within the sentences with synonym replacements (at least every other fourth word).
4. Set a few of the sentences or paragraphs to optional for even more variation.

If you follow this advice, you will get highly different output that will stay readable.
